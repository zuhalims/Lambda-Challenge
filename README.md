# Lambda Challenge 

If you have not yet filled out the form at [https://lambdaschool.com/challenge/](https://lambdaschool.com/challenge/) please do that before submitting your pull request.

In order to remove even more barriers for those that want to participate in Lambda School, we've created the Lambda Challenge.

Based on our data, we are confident that if you can complete the Lambda Challenge, we can help you learn to code, and get a job as a developer. We're willing to bet on you.

Pending a final interview, those that complete the Lambda Challenge successfully may be invited to attend Lambda School without paying anything upfront; no loans, no debt, and no upfront tuition. 
Pay nothing at all until you're making $50k+ as a software engineer.

After the completion of the Lambda Challenge, we'll schedule you for a priority interview, and you can skip the pre-course work that we normally require.

If the questions in here are too difficult then you can begin working through our regular precourse work which covers the fundamentals [here](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Precourse).
